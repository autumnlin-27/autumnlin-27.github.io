    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      This website is a personal research project about how people build meaning into space—
      and how architecture reflects culture, belief, and history.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I made this project</h2>
    <p>
      I grew up familiar with feng shui as part of a Chinese cultural background, but I have always
      been more interested in <em>how</em> people use spatial ideas than in treating them as unquestionable truths.
      In cities like Singapore—where religious buildings, colonial legacies, and high-density modern planning coexist—
      architecture becomes a visible record of cultural negotiation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project lets me turn curiosity into action: visiting places, documenting what I see,
      and comparing how different communities organize space—especially when the buildings are not traditionally
      “Chinese” in form or belief.
    </p>

    <h2>What I am trying to do</h2>
    <p>
      I treat feng shui as a comparative lens: a way to notice orientation, movement, thresholds, and relationships
      between built form and environment. I then place those observations alongside historical context and
      the internal logic of each religious tradition.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Field-based:</strong> photos and on-site observation</li>
      <li><strong>Contextual:</strong> historical and cultural background</li>
      <li><strong>Comparative:</strong> Singapore ↔ Malaysia, and across religions</li>
      <li><strong>Bilingual:</strong> English explanations for readers unfamiliar with feng shui, and Chinese for cultural nuance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why bilingual</h2>
    <p>
      Feng shui often gets reduced to stereotypes in English-language spaces. Writing bilingually forces me to clarify
      concepts rather than assume shared cultural knowledge. It also helps me translate not only language, but
      intellectual framing—so the project remains rigorous and readable across audiences.
