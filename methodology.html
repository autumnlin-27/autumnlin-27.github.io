    <h1>Methodology</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      This project approaches feng shui not as a system of belief,
      but as a spatial and cultural framework for interpreting architecture.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytical Position</h2>
    <p>
      Feng shui is treated here as a historically situated way of thinking
      about orientation, movement, balance, and the relationship between
      built form and environment. Rather than assuming its universal validity,
      I examine how its principles align, conflict, or adapt when applied
      across different cultural and religious contexts.
    </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      Each case study follows a consistent analytical process:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Observation of site orientation and surrounding geography</li>
      <li>Analysis of circulation, thresholds, and spatial hierarchy</li>
      <li>Consideration of historical and cultural context</li>
      <li>Interpretation through selected feng shui concepts as analytical tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cross-Cultural Application</h2>
    <p>
      When examining non-Chinese religious architecture, feng shui is not
      imposed as an evaluative standard. Instead, it functions as a comparative
      lens, allowing differences in spatial logic and symbolic emphasis
      to become visible. This approach prioritizes respect for internal
      religious meanings while exploring points of resonance and divergence.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      This methodology does not claim predictive or normative authority.
      Its purpose is interpretive: to understand how ideas about space,
      order, and meaning are embedded within architectural form and
      shaped by cultural context.
